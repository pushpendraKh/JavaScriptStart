//searchTermSelector is a basic input selector responsible
// for simply returning the current value of searchTerm
 // from the Redux state tree. caseInsensitiveSearchTermSelector
  // takes searchTermSelector as an input and transforms it to a 
  //lowercase string for case- insensitive searching. 
  //Finally, searchNewsSelector takes two inputsâ€“our previous reshapeNewsSelector
  // and caseInsensitiveSearchTermSelector. These are passed as arguments to the
  // filterNewsBySearchTerm function. The returning value from filterNewsBySearchTerm 
  //will ultimately be the data exposed to the SearchContainer.
